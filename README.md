# Rentalwheels
Rental wheels is a car renting app that enables users to easily rent a car. You first create an account, and your details are saved in the database. You can pick which type of the car you want, then it takes you to a page that shows the car information, pickup hours and location. When placing the order, you have to input your document details (passport, National ID or VISA), select on hours, days, dates and time then proceed to checkout.
