# Rentalwheels
- Rental wheels is a car renting app that enables users to easily rent a car. You first create an account, and your details are saved in the database.
- You can pick which type of the car you want, then it takes you to a page that shows the car information, pickup hours and location. 
- When placing the order, you have to input your document details (passport, National ID or VISA), select on hours, days, dates and time then proceed to checkout.
- The payment method used is Flutterwave where a user has the option of paying via Mpesa or a credit card. However, we couldn't go live and thus a user cannot pay in realtime.
